# ESP32-CAM Motion-Activated Smart Surveillance Camera

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a cost-effective, motion-activated surveillance camera using an ESP32-CAM module with Blynk-based notifications for real-time monitoring. The system detects motion using a PIR sensor, captures images/videos, and sends alerts to users via Blynk IoT. Additional features include parent-child notifications, a buzzer alert system, and cloud storage integration, making it a smart and reliable home security solution.
