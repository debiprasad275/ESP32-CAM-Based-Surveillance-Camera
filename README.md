# ESP32-CAM Motion-Activated Smart Surveillance Camera

📌 Overview
This project is a cost-effective, motion-activated surveillance camera using an ESP32-CAM module with Blynk-based notifications for real-time monitoring. The system detects motion using a PIR sensor, captures images/videos, and sends alerts to users via Blynk IoT. Additional features include parent-child notifications, a buzzer alert system, and cloud storage integration, making it a smart and reliable home security solution.

⚙️ Features
✅ Motion Detection – PIR sensor triggers camera upon detecting movement.
✅ Real-Time Notifications – Alerts sent via the Blynk IoT platform to multiple users.
✅ Parent-Child Notification – Alerts both primary (parent) and secondary (child) users.
✅ Live Video Streaming – View real-time footage via the Blynk app.
✅ Buzzer Alarm – Audible alert when motion is detected.
✅ Local & Cloud Storage – Saves images/videos on a microSD card and can upload to cloud storage.
✅ Low Power Mode – ESP32-CAM enters deep sleep to conserve battery life.
✅ Customizable Sensitivity – Adjustable PIR sensor to minimize false alarms.
✅ Multi-Camera Support – Expandable system for monitoring multiple locations.

🛠️ Components Used
